# Todo App

# I finally started a Todo App. I know it's a basic project, but it's a CRUD application, which means Create, Read, Update and Delete application.

Right now it's still not done, but the repo is up and running and i will update this project, until it's done.

### The technologies used:

So far i used:
HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. I will also use some media queries to make it responsive.
